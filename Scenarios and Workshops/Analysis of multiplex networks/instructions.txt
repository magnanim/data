# Tutorial: Analysis of Multiplex Social Networks (hands-on)

## Requirements

The only thing needed to participate in this tutorial is a recent version of R and the library "multinet" installed. You can install it typing:

install.packages("multinet")

in your R console. As long as you can load the library, typing:

library(multinet)

you are ready to go!

## Useful additional resources

The following is some additional information that you might find useful during or after the tutorial.

- We recommend having RStudio installed - in general, not just for this tutorial.

- The following libraries can be useful to generate some nicer plots and results. They can be installed in a few minutes by typing this code into your R console:

install.packages("multinet")
install.packages("knitr")
install.packages("pander")
install.packages("gplots")
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("tibble")
install.packages("rmarkdown")
install.packages("rprojroot")
install.packages("formatR")
install.packages("corrplot")

The file workshop.Rmd can be opened with RStudio, so you have all the code there for your future reference. The file workshop.pdf is generated starting from the workshop.Rmd file and the libraries mentioned above - just click on Knit in the RStudio menu and choose the output (PDF, word, HTML). You can also execute individual parts of the document and play with the code.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
